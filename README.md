todo-compose is a simple yet production-ready To-Do Android app built with Jetpack Compose, MVVM, and Clean Architecture.
It demonstrates modern Android development best practices — using Hilt for dependency injection, Room for offline persistence, and Coroutines/Flow for reactive data streams.

The goal of this project is to showcase a clean, scalable structure suitable for real-world applications, including a full local data layer, well-defined domain logic, and a Compose-based UI with proper state management and testing support.
